        extend: {
            fontFamily: {
                'sans': ['Figtree', 'ui-sans-serif', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
            },
            colors: {
                'brand-accent': '#A5B4FC', // indigo-300
                'brand-text': '#020617',   // slate-950

/* Theme-specific overrides */
.light { /* Light theme styles */ }

.cloudy { /* Mixed theme styles */ }
.paint { /* Purple theme styles */ }
```

### Typography Scale

- **Subheadings**: `text-xl lg:text-2xl` for section subheadings  
- **Body**: `text-lg` for primary content
- **Captions**: `text-sm` for metadata and labels

### Spacing System
- **Sections**: `py-20` for consistent vertical rhythm
- **Containers**: `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6` for content width
- **Components**: `space-x-*` and `space-y-*` for consistent gaps
